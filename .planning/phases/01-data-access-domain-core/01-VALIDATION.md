# Phase 1 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | vitest 4.x |
| **Config file** | none — Wave 0 installs |
| **Quick run command** | `npx vitest run --changed` |
| **Full suite command** | `npx vitest run` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~10 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx vitest run --changed`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npx vitest run`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 30 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| (filled by planner) | | | | | | | | | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] Node/TS workspace scaffold with vitest installed and a passing smoke test
- [ ] Test stubs for domain math (circular mean, coverage-honest N, precip aggregation, renormalized score)

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Veðurstofan terms/attribution confirmed | DATA-08 | Legal text review, not executable | Read captured terms in RESEARCH.md; confirm attribution wording documented for UI |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 30s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
